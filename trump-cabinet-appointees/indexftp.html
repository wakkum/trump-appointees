                <p>Meet the backroom staff, advisers, spin doctors and pollsters behind Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>
                <p>The Federal Election Campaigns Act of 1971 gives each US Presidential candidate the right to assemble a campaign organisation distinct from the national party staff. The group usually includes an inner circle of advisers who are close to the candidates.</p>
                <p>Both <a href="#trump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="#clinton">Hillary Clinton's</a> campaigns include a campaign manager, a chief pollster, communications director heading a communications team, policy advisers and general diary manager.</p>
                <p>The candidates' inner circle are often people who have either worked with them in previous campaigns, served them in comparable positions, or are long-term close acquaintances.</p>
                <p>Whoever becomes President, they will certainly appoint many of his or her inner circle into powerful positions within the White House.</p>

              <h4>Campaign Chairman</h4>
              <hr>
              <p class="text-left">In August 2016, Podesta was appointed to lead Hillary Clinton's presidential transition planning efforts, focusing on "creating lists of potential administration appointees and developing a roadmap for her policy agenda".</p>
              <p class="text-left">Podesta was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff in the White House and later the founder of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think-tank. Podesta is also well-regarded by the Clintons and President Barack Obama. He stepped down earlier this year as Counsellor to Obama. His presence in the team is to steer a possible Hillary win to help integrate longtime Clinton allies and newer former Obama staffers. In July 2016, The New York Times reported that Podesta would have "the right of first refusal on becoming Clinton's chief of staff if she wins".</p>

              <h4>Campaigns Vice Chairwoman</h4>
              <hr>
              <p class="text-left">Abedin is seen as Hillary's shadow who manages operations in the campaign. She began working with Hillary Clinton as an intern when Hillary Clinton was First Lady and went on to work as her aide when she was New York Senator and as deputy chief of staff during Mrs Clinton's years as Secretary of State. In a 2016 Vanity Fair profile, the magazine summarised the relationship between Clinton and Abedin: "Wherever Hillary goes, Abedin goes". Abedin is involved at the highest level in discussions of tone, messaging and strategy for the campaign. Abedin is tipped to be Deputy Chief of Staff if Hillary Clinton wins.</p>

              <p class="text-left">Mook was part of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008, directing the ground operations in Ohio, Indiana and Nevada, three states which Hillary Clinton won. As campaign manager, Mook is responsible for strategy and messaging in all aspects of the campaign. Mook, in his mid-30s, is known for a calm, measured demeanour, an aversion to the spotlight and an interest in data, which resulted in The Guardian dubbing him as a ""a political nerd who lives and dies by data". He has also served as executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p>

Benenson's jobs before becoming a pollster in 1995, included working as a political journalist for the New York Daily News, a stint in beer distribution and a role in the knife sales industry.</p>

He is a major asset to her and brings with him a cadre of friends and advisers. The question on people's minds is if Hillary becomes President, what role does Bill take. He has said he would be willing to sit in on cabinet meetings if asked, serving as a sort of benign elder statesman. He added, however: "I think it's better for me to give her my advice privately most of the time."</p>

              <hr>
              <p class="text-left">Bannon temporarily stood down as executive chairman of Brietbart News, a right-wing news organisation which favours Trump, to become his campaign chairman in August 2016. Bannon has been accused of using Breitbart as "Trump's personal Pravda", now as campaign chairman he is considered to have made the Trump campaign return to the "bare-knuckles brawl" politics and populist rhetoric that had energised much of Trump's primary run. His appointment has caused controversy as many news outlets have run stories about Bannon involving a 20-year-old domestic-violence charge and an allegation of voter-registration fraud. A Bloomberg article last year described him as "the most dangerous political operative in America".</p>

The 27-year-old public relations professional had never worked on a political campaign and had joined the Trump's campaign in 2016 after working with Trump's daughter, fashion designer Ivanka. Hicks is the go-to person for journalists covering Trump's White House bid. Hicks is reportedly integral to Trump's controversial Twitter posts and takes dictation from Trump on various subjects and then sends his thoughts to someone else to make it into a tweet. Trump trusts her so much that she alone decides which media gets in and who's kept out of Trump's events.</p>

He is often called Trump’s "campaign confidant", "long-time ally" and "closest political adviser". A political campaigning veteran, Stone has built his reputation on controversy and dirty tricks. During his time on the Nixon campaign, for example, he reportedly created a fake identity, and made multiple donations to Nixon's opponent from the Young Socialist Alliance. He then tipped off a local newspaper about those donations, to prove Nixon's opponent was a left-wing extremist. His friendship with Trump matured in 2012, during Trump's campaign to question the validity of President Obama's birth certificate. Stone was credited with advising Trump on the strategy, and Stone himself called the accusations "brilliant" as "It gives voice to a concern shared by many on the right."</p>
